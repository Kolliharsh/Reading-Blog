                <h3>This is my blog about Reading , yep you guessed it ! Many people do a blog about their life , interests , hobbies , etc but mine is about reading. You could say reading is my hobby and interest but in this blog I have made it entirely on READING! I have six sections ... The reading to me section tells others what reading means to me. In the famous books I will list good books and books that I love. For the genres section , I will give some ecamples of books with each genre. The history of books section will have some famous books throughout history and what reading was like in each era. The process section will have the process of making a book and publishing it. Finally , favourite authors and illistrators will have some legends passed on throughout history and some of my favourites as well.Be on the lookout for more blogs , apps and games like this and be sure to remember that I will continue to update information in all of my creations and add new sections in them on a daily basis.

        <h3>Hello!</h3>
        <div class="line"></div>
             <p>My hobby is reading. It brings us into a world where dreams become reality and we have a chance to escape into that world. They also give us incredible amounts of knowledge , that is very useful for us to apply into the real world. Reading is a useful and fantastic hobby. Most of the successful people in the world , read at least 30 minutes per day. So you see ... reading is wonderful and knowledgeable . You may think you or someone else reads too much but you are wrong , it is you who are under estimating them. No matter what you read , you will improve every day . You don't need to only read this or that anything will make a change to your reading ability.Reading has been here forever. It has just evoled from different things. Like in the beggining of time , when there were cavemen and stuff like that ... reading was trying to intercept the drawings . Now in modern times , we can read stuff everywhere.Like road signs , books and many more. We read the drawings , writings , signs, and in the future a new type of reading might come . I trust that reading will live until the end of time and continue to devlop more and more ...</p>
